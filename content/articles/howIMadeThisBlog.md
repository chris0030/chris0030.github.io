I've hosted blogs in many different ways during my time online. I've created 
my own, hosted on various providers (Wordpress, Squarespace, Blogger, 
Facebook to name a new), used various hosting companies, and much much more.

I've never been satisfied with the result. They all felt too fiddly, or gave 
away too much control, or in some cases, shut down! It always highlighted a 
flaw in how we provide content online. I don't believe this flaw is improving
over time. When we look at the misbehavings at Twitter and Facebook around 
content moderation it's clear that trading ease of hosting and uploading for 
control of our content was not the right decision for me at least.

With this in mind and following a rather lively and lubricated conversation 
with my wonderful friend Bryan, we decided to look at the options available
nowadays. I'll try to list my own requirements here...

## Requirements

1. I should "own the content" ie. it should be hosted in a way that I don't 
    cede ownership
1. It should be version controlled. Git is amazing, I want to use it
1. The content should be separated from the styling. Markdown ftw!
1. It should be platform agnostic. I want it to be trivial to move and host
1. It should be cheap at worst, free at best. No monthly costs please!
1. It should be simple enough for someone who doesn't do this stuff for 
    a living to emulate.


## My solution

The solution I decided to at least attempt to implement was as follows. A 
static website generated with a Static Site Generator (I picked Zola)
hosted for free on Github Pages,
